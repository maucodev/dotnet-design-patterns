# Visitor Pattern

## Summary

The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This pattern lets you define new operations on objects without changing the objects themselves. The pattern achieves this by introducing a visitor object that implements the operation logic and is able to "visit" elements of different types.

## Components

- **Visitor**: An interface or abstract class defining a visit method for each type of element it can handle. Each visit method performs a specific operation on the element of the corresponding type.
- **Concrete Visitor**: A class that implements the Visitor interface and defines specific behaviors for the visit methods. This class contains the actual logic of the operation to be performed on the elements.
- **Element**: An interface or abstract class that declares an `accept` method, which takes a Visitor as an argument. The `accept` method allows the Visitor to visit the element and execute its operation.
- **Concrete Element**: A class that implements the Element interface. Each Concrete Element provides an implementation of the `accept` method that allows the Visitor to perform its operation on it.
- **Object Structure**: A class that maintains a collection of elements and provides a method to accept a Visitor. This structure iterates over its elements and calls the `accept` method on each element, passing the Visitor.
